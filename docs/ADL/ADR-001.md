# ADR-001: File Metadata Storage Without a Database

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-07  
**Decision Number**: ADR-001  
**Context**: File Upload & AV Scanning System

---

## Context

The system processes file uploads via an API. The flow is:

```

Client → API → Hash → Scan (ClamAV) → Store in Object Storage (S3/MinIO)

```

Key characteristics:
- Only clean files are stored.
- There is no LIST API or UI for querying uploaded files.
- AV scan results are not persisted.
- The system operates as a stateless, one-way pipeline: each file is either accepted, scanned, and stored, or rejected and discarded.

---

## Decision

We will not introduce a database into the system. Instead:

- Files will be stored in object storage (S3/MinIO) after passing the AV scan.
- Minimal metadata (e.g., original filename, upload timestamp, hash, MIME type) will be stored as a sidecar file in the same bucket, using a `.meta.json` extension and the same hash-based key.
- No relational or structured querying of file data is required.
- All observability needs will be handled via Prometheus metrics and application logs.

## Rationale

| Consideration     | Why a database is not needed |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Querying/search   | The system has no requirement to list or search uploaded files |
| Ownership         | There is no per-user model or access control requirement |
| Audit/history     | No long-term traceability or compliance obligations exist |
| AV results        | Results are used only in-process and not persisted |
| System design     | The architecture is a one-directional, event-driven pipeline |
| Operational cost  | Avoiding a database reduces infrastructure and operational overhead |

The design prioritizes simplicity, minimal moving parts, and a clear boundary between pipeline stages.

---

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Simpler system architecture
- Stateless and easy to scale
- Lower maintenance and deployment overhead
- Reduced external dependencies

**Trade-offs:**
- Limited ability to introspect or query metadata externally
- No persistent scan result storage
- Introducing listing, ownership, or analytics features would require future refactoring

---

## Future Considerations

If the system evolves to include:

- File listing, filtering, or search
- Per-user metadata or quota tracking
- Persistent AV scan results
- Workflow state transitions (e.g., scanned → approved → expired)
- Dashboards or admin analytics

Then a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) should be introduced as a system-of-record indexed by file hash.

## Example Object Storage Layout

```

/files/
sha256-abc123.bin
/meta/
sha256-abc123.meta.json

````

Example metadata file (`sha256-abc123.meta.json`):

```json
{
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "sha256": "abc123...",
  "mime": "application/pdf",
  "uploaded_at": "2025-07-07T08:43:00Z"
}
````
